# Syncing with a Parent Server

Below are instructions on configuring the parent URL of the data server, stopping the server, and running the sync script.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- Systemd (for managing the service)

## Configuration

### Setting the Parent URL

1. Navigate to the `data-server-node` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/data-server-node
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor:

   ```bash
   vim .env
   ```

3. Locate the `PARENT_NODE_URL` line. Uncomment it if it is commented out, and set the desired URL:

   ```env
   PARENT_NODE_URL="https://csiwiki.me.columbia.edu/rocketsdata2"
   ```

4. Save and close the file.

5. Restart the server to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart data-server-node
   ```

6. Verify the server is using the correct parent URL by checking the logs:

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -f -u data-server-node
   ```

   Look for a log entry like:

   ```
   üì° Using parent node at https://csiwiki.me.columbia.edu/rocketsdata2
   ```

## Stopping the Server

To stop the data server, execute the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop data-server-node
```

## Running the Sync Script

1. Ensure the server is stopped as described above.

2. Run the sync worker script using Bun:

   ```bash
   bun run src/scripts/run-sync-worker.ts
   ```

   You should see output indicating the sync worker has started:

   ```
   üì° Using parent node at https://csiwiki.me.columbia.edu/rocketsdata2
   üîÑ Started sync worker
   ‚è≥ Records are out of date
   ```

## Additional Scripts

- **Start Server**: To start the server, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl start data-server-node
```

- **Manual Upload Script**: If you need to run a manual upload script, ensure the server is stopped, then execute:

```bash
bun run src/scripts/delete-synced-records.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are installed and up to date.
- Check logs for any errors or warnings using:

```bash
sudo journalctl -f -u data-server-node
```

- Verify your `.env` file is correctly configured with valid URLs and credentials.
